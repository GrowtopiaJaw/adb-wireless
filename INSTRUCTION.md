1. Connect your device to your computer via USB
2. Make sure that USB debugging is enabled in [Device--> Settings--> Developer options]
3. Make sure that your computer and your device are connected to Wi-Fi or your Mobile Hotspot

NOTE: This is mandatory. Before you connect your device with adb via Wi-Fi, you must connect it via USB to your computer first.
Once adb is connected via Wi-Fi, you can remove the USB
